/**
 * The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a
 * keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes
 * either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,” or a single number
 * followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed
 * within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static
 * ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that
 * striation, indicated here as “[P/T].”
