/**
 * Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost.
 * Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a
 * number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature a minus sign
 * followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols don’t point in either
 * direction and feature a 0. [+N] means "Put N loyalty counters on this
 * permanent," [-N] means “Remove N loyalty counters from this permanent,” and
 * [0] means “Put zero loyalty counters on this permanent.” Loyalty symbols may
 * also appear in abilities that modify loyalty costs.
